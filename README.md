# AHKScripts
My AutoHotKey scripts

# Files
- The `.ahk` files are the raw autohotkey files
- The `.exe` files are compiled autohotkey files that include the autohotkey v2.0.2 runtime
- If you download the `.ahk` you need to manually install autohotkey to run them. If you download the `.exe` files you don't need anything else.
